Inspired by the work of legendary New York chef Daniel Humm, this is no ordinary hotdog. Wrapped in bacon, smothered in truffle mayonnaise and topped with Gruyère, this indulgent and unusual take on a family favourite is one for the more courageous chef...but never disappoints.

## Ingredients

### Celery Relish

- 5 tablespoons peeled celery root, diced 1/4 inch
- 4 tablespoons celery, diced 1/4 inch
- 3 tablespoons half-sour pickles, diced 1/4 inch
- 1 tablespoon Pickled mustard seeds
- 1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar
- 1 teaspoon black truffle, diced 1/4 inch

### Truffle mayonnaise

- 4 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 2 teaspoons black truffles, finely chopped

### The Humm Dog

- Canola oil
- 4 slices bacon
- 4 hot dogs
- 4 hot dog buns
- 4 slices Gruyère
- Celery heart leaves



## Directions

### The Relish

1. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil over high heat and prepare an ice bath. Blanch the celery root in the boiling water until tender, about 5 minutes, and shock in the ice bath. Blanch the celery in the boiling water until tender, about 3 minutes, and shock in the ice bath. When cold, drain the celery root and celery from the ice bath. Transfer the vegetables to paper towels to drain any excess water.

2. In a mixing bowl, combine the blanched vegetables with the pickles, pickled mustard seeds, and vinegar and mix well. When ready to plate, fold in the diced black truffle.

### The Truffle Mayonnaise

1.	Combine the mayonnaise with the truffles in a mixing bowl and fold together with a rubber spatula. Reserve the mayonnaise in an airtight container, refrigerated, for up to 3 days.

### The Humm Dog

1.	Preheat the oven to 175°C/350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Heat 7.5 cm (3 inches) of canola oil in a heavy pot over medium heat to 175°C/350°F. Wrap a slice of bacon around each hot dog and use wooden toothpicks to secure it. Fry in the hot oil until the bacon is crisped and the hot dog is heated through, about 3 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Remove and discard the toothpicks.
2.	Spread each hot dog bun with truffle mayonnaise. Place a fried hot dog in each bun and top with a slice of Gruyère. Place the hot dogs on the prepared baking sheet and transfer to the oven. Heat the hot dogs just until the cheese is melted, about 2 minutes.
3.	Remove from the oven and top each with the celery relish. Garnish with celery heart leaves and serve immediately.
