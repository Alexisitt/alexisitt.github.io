# Some of My Favourites...

On this site you will find some of the weird and wonderful recipes that I have brought together to share both on this blog and in a collation of equally bizarre yet utterly delicious recipes entitled The Culinary Contrarian.

For both the book and the individual selection and curation of these recipes, my intention was twofold. I wanted to be able to present unique, sometimes outright weird ingredients in a way that would make them sound irresistible to even the fussiest of food critic.
