# Some of My Favourites...

On this page you will find some of the weird and wonderful recipes that I have brought together to share both on this blog and in a collation of equally bizarre yet utterly delicious recipes entitled The Culinary Contrarian.

For both the book and the individual selection and curation of these recipes, my intention was twofold. I wanted to be able to present unique, sometimes outright weird ingredients in a way that would make them sound irresistible to even the fussiest of food critic.

Below I have included some images of some further exciting recipes to try, that I am particularly fond of!

## Sea Urchin Guacamole Tacos


## Nduja Avocado Toast



## Everything Bagel Nigiri
